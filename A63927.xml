            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THere are now ſome few Years over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt ſince I laſt appeared publick amongſt you; yet I cannot think my ſelf quite forgotten and obliterated out of your Memories, or at leaſt of ſome of you, by whom I preſume I have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>read,</hi> though not ſeen: Give me leave after ſome ſilence to trouble you once more; and I doubt not after you have well conſidered the ſubject, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſpence with the trouble and pains I give you; finding that vanquiſhed by the pleaſure and profit you will reap by it: For if the Axiom be true, as undoubtedly it is, that three things principally concurre as the moving cauſes in the atchievement
<pb facs="tcp:43081:3"/>of every Action, viz. <hi>Pleaſure, Profit,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> you will finde them all conſpired together in the Enterprize of this Work: A Work perchance, which at firſt bluſh will be by ſome (eſpecially by thoſe of the <hi>Romantique Phyſicians</hi> Tribe) cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſuperfluous; and by others objected againſt as not copious enough for their thoughts, although too perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat for their practice: they may both ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be anſwered, and if they will ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider it, the Book it ſelf ſufficiently anſwers all objections may be made againſt it; there being compendiouſly contained in it the compleat body of Medicinal Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; the ſeveral names both Latine, Greek, and Engliſh; the degrees of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, whereby their Nature and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are known and diſtinguiſhed of all ſuch Herbs, Plants, Seeds, Fruits, and Roots as are uſeful in Phyſick, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally growing in <hi>England,</hi> or common to be had at our Druggiſts and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:43081:4"/>Shops: ſo that when I tell you the Vertues of Fruits or Drugs which grow in the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, I do not bid you go thither and fetch them; the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Merchant hath ſaved you that labour, and brought them home to your Doors. And this hath not been exactly performed by any Engliſh Phyſician in ſuch a Method before.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe ſet down to many Plants the Aſtral influence aſſigned unto them by Aſtrologers: thoſe that are ſtudious in that Science may ſoon acquaint themſelves with the reſt, which I have willingly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; having to every Plant laid down the Degrees of the Temperature thereof, whereby the Nature, Vertue, or Danger thereof is eaſily known: and indeed he fell a great deal too ſhort, that pretends he ſtudied to finde a reaſon why ſuch a Herb cured ſuch a Diſeaſe, and concludes he found it in (the ſecondary Cauſe I grant) the Stars; but if he would have added a
<pb facs="tcp:43081:4"/>little Chriſtianity to his ſtudy, it would have raiſed his Contemplation higher, and he would have found the true reaſon and primary Cauſe to have come from above the Stars, from him that gave the Stars their Vertues; and concluded with the ſame reaſon that the Heathen Poet did, touching the Creation of the World, and the Stars themſelves,
<q>
                  <l>Sic onus incluſum numero diſtinxit eodem</l>
                  <l>Cura Dei.—</l>
                  <l>Even ſo it ſeem'd to the Creator beſt.</l>
               </q> Nevertheleſs let us give the Stars their due, and all the candid and ingenious Students and Contemplators of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Vertues and Influences; but let us not abuſe them, and diſhonour the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, as the ſpurious <hi>Sigilators,</hi> and <hi>Taleſmen,</hi> or <hi>Teleſmemongers</hi> do. Let us likewiſe be thankful unto Almighty God for thoſe bleſſings he hath beſtowed upon us, in enduing the Plants and Graſs of the Field with ſuch ſalubrious Faculties for our health and preſervation; but let us
<pb facs="tcp:43081:5"/>not offer Sacrifices unto them, and ſay Charms over them as the <hi>Druids</hi> of old, and other Heathens; and ſo do ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymiſts, Medean Hags, and Sorcerers now adayes; who not contented with the lawful uſe of the Creatures, out of ſome Diabolical intention, ſearch after the more <hi>Magical</hi> and occult Vertues of Herbs and Plants to accompliſh ſome wicked ends; and for that very cauſe King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> fearing leſt the Herbals of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould come into prophane Hands cauſed them to be burned.</p>
            <p>God hath imprinted upon the Plants, Herbs, and Flowers, as it were in Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks, the very ſignature of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; as the learned <hi>Grollius</hi> and others well obſerve: as, the Nutmeg being cut, reſembles the Brain, the <hi>Papaver Errati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> or red Poppey flower, reſembleth at its bottom the ſettling of the Blood in the Pluriſie; and how excellent is that flower in Diſeaſes of the Pluriſie and Surfeits,
<pb facs="tcp:43081:5"/>hath ſufficiently been experienced. In the <hi>Heliotrope</hi> and <hi>Marigold,</hi> Subjects may learn their duty to their Sovereign; which his Sacred Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt mentions in his Princely Meditations, walking in a Garden in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> in the following Words, viz.</p>
            <p>

Reader I ſhall not trouble you any longer without doors, but onely give you one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement by the way, and conclude. The Book, for the more ready finding any Plant you would look for in it, is compoſed according to the order of the Letters in the Alphabet; and beſides an Alphabetical Table of each Plant contained in the Book: Now becauſe one Plant may have ſeveral appellations, when you look for any one in the Table in the page of the Book which you are directed to, perhaps you may not finde the ſame name in the Title of the Plant there treated of; then
<pb facs="tcp:43081:6"/>do but caſt your eye to the Names under the Deſcription of the Plant you finde in that Page you are directed to, and there you will finde the Plant here deſcribed called by the ſame name you look for. I ſhall at preſent ſay no more, but wiſh this Book, and the Students therein happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and their deſires both in pleaſure and profit; ſubſcribing my ſelf</p>

                     <hi>IT is needleſs to deſcribe the Apple trees, nor reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up their ſeveral kindes, many ſorts of them being generally known to almoſt every boy, and is out of my purpoſe here; many of them are early ripe in Summer, others more late towards Winter, which are moſt durable to keep; ſome of them are ſweet, fragrant and odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, others more ſharp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Names.] <hi>The tree is called in Latine,</hi> Pomus <hi>and</hi> malus, <hi>the fruit</hi> Pomum <hi>and</hi> malum. <hi>The Engliſh name you have already.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Places and Time.] <hi>They grow wilde in the hedge rows and Woods in many places of this Land, but the beſt are manured in Orchards; they flower in</hi> April, <hi>the fruit of the lateſt is ripe in</hi> October, <hi>which is the</hi> John <hi>Apple.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Temperature, and Vertues.]</hi> There is a great difference in Apples, in regard there are both ſweet, ſowre, and bitter, they are generally held to be cold and moiſt, but the ſweet and bitter do ſomewhat incline to heat; but to omit the general uſe which is made of Apples both in City and Countrey, they are effectual in hot diſeaſes, cooling the ſtomack and heart. The Apple called a Pomewater being roaſted, and the pulp labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fair water, till it be like that we call Lambs-wool, and drunk going to bed, helpeth ſuch as are troubled with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary paſſage of the ſeed, either in dreams or otherwiſe; and is alſo effectual for ſuch as piſs by drops, Rotten apples are good to be applyed to the eyes which are blood-ſhotten, or bruiſed by any ſtripe or ſtroke. Apples expel melancholly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and stir up mirth, being roaſted and eaten with roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſugar: Cider and alſo Verjuyce do both ſingularly cool the ſtomack, and is effectual in hot Agues, and is good againſt caſting and vomiting; and the verjuyce being applyed to burnings or ſcaldings, draweth out the fire, and cools and heals the ſame.</p>

An Angel of gold, or the weight thereof in leaf Gold ſteeped four and twenty hours in four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the juyce of Lemons, and ſome of that juyce given in a Cup of Wine, with ſome powder of Angelica root, is very good to be given to ſuch as are infected with the Plague. The juyce is good in Fevers to quench thirst, and ſo is the poſſet made of it. A water diſtilled in a glaſs from the pulp of Lemons, provokes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine being drunk, and helps to break the Stone; it likewiſe cleanſes the skin, kills lice in the Head, helps run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Scabs, and Wheals in the Skin.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take a handful of Mill Mountain, the whole plant, leaves, ſeeds, flowers and all, bruiſe it and put it in a ſmall Pipkin, with a pint of white Wine, and ſet it on the Embers to infuſe all night, and drink that wine in the morning faſting: This he ſaith he was told (by a ſervant of one Dr.</hi> Lake, <hi>who lived at St.</hi> Croſs near Wincheſter) <hi>would give eight or ten ſtools.

A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the roots and leaves of Nettles, or the juyce thereof taken in an Electuary with Honey or Sugar, is a good medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to open the obſtructions of the Lungs, and a remedy againſt Wheeſing, and ſhortneſs of Breath; it expectorates tough Phlegm, and evacuates an impoſtumated Pluriſie by ſpittle; it is a good gargle to help ſwellings of the Throat, and the Almonds of the Throat, and ſwellings in the Mouth: The leaves boiled in Wine and drunk, provokes Womens Courſes, helps ſuffocations, and other diſeaſes of the Mother, and ſo it doth, being outwardly applyed with a little Myrrhe. The ſame alſo, or the ſeed taken, provokes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, and expells the Gravel or Stone out of the Reins and Bladder; it killeth worms in Children, eaſeth pains in the ſides, and diſſolves windineſs of the Spleen, and in the Body; yet ſome do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it onely effectual to provoke Venery. The juyce of the leaves taken two or three dayes together, ſtayeth bleeding at Mouth. The ſeed taken in drink is a remedy againſt venomous bitings, and the biting of a mad Dog, and reſiſts the poiſon of Hemlock, Henbane, and Night-ſhade, Mandrakes, and other ſtupifying Herbs; as alſo for the Lethargy, to rub it upon the Forehead and Temples, and upon the places bitten or stung by venomous Beaſts, with a little Salt. The diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is effectual for the ſaid purpoſes, (yet more weak) and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to waſh Sores and Wounds, to cleanſe the skin from the Morphew, Leproſie, and other deformities thereof. The ſeed or leaves bruiſed and put into the Neſtrils, ſtayeth Bleeding thereof, and takes away the excreſcenſe growing there called Pollipus. The juyce of the leaves or the decoction of them, or the roots, is good to waſh old rotten Sores, Fiſtula's, or Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens, and corroding Scabs, Mangineſs, or Itch in any part
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43081:120"/>of the Body, and is good alſo to waſh green Wounds, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the freſh bruiſed herb thereunto, though the fleſh were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the bones. The ſame is good to refreſh wearied members, and to comfort, dry, and ſtrengthen ſuch parts as have been out of joynt, and are ſet again; and alſo for Aches and Gouts, and to eaſethe pains, and to dry and diſſolve the defluxions of humours upon the Joynts and Sinews. An oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of the juyce, oyl, and wax, is good to rub benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med members to reduce them to their proper activity. A hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of green Nettle leaves, and another of Danewort, or Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, bruiſed and applyed to the Gout, Sciatica, or joynt Aches, is a good help thereunto. The young tops of Nettles being uſed in pottage in the Spring, are good to conſume phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſuperfluities in the Body, and clarifie and warm the Blood: give Hens dry Nettles cut ſmall amongst their meat in Winter, and it will make them lay Eggs the more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.</p>

The juyce eaſeth pains and Inflammations of the Ears, being dropped therein: and the juyce clarified and mingled with Vinegar, is a good garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme for the Mouth and Throat, being inflamed. The juyce of the herb or Berries incorporated in a leaden Mortar with Oyl of Roſes, Vinegar, and Ceruſs, is good to anoint the Eyes for all hot Inflammations.

Rubarb is certainly a herb af <hi>Jupiter;</hi> it is called the friend, the life, heart, and treacle of the Liver, being ſo effectual for the ſame; it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it of Choller, Phlegm, and watry humors, and helps the hardneſs and coldneſs thereof, and is uſeful in chollerick and long continued Fevers, in the Jaundies, Green Sickneſs, Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſie, and ſtoppings of the Liver, the powder ſteeped in White Wine all night, and drunk faſting, or being taken amongſt other purges; being taken in powder with Caſsia, and a little Venice Turpentine Waſhed, it cleanſeth the Reins, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, and is effectual to ſtay a Gonorrhea, or running of the Reins; it is alſo good againſt pains, windineſs, wambling, and weakneſs of the ſtomach, Cramp, gnawings, and gripings of the Kidneys, Belly. and Bladder, pains of the Breaſts, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Sciatica; it helps ſpitting of blood, the Hicket, bloody Flux, Lasks, and all venomous ſtingings and bitings, one dram thereof taken in Hydromel, or honied water; it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43081:148"/>the Gout, helpeth thoſe that are troubled with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and is good againſt pains and Swellings of the Head: It is moſt properly inſuſed in Whey or White Wine, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors make it work more effectually in opening obſtructions and purging the Liver and Stomach. The oyl wherein Rubarb hath been boiled is good to anoint any bruiſed place, to diſſolve the clotted Blood; and Rubarb taken in powder with Mummy and Madder-roots in red Wine, healeth Burſtings and broken parts as well inward as outward, and diſſolveth clotted Blood in the Body, occaſioned by any fall or bruiſe. Rubarb ſteeped in white Wine, or any other convenient liquor, and strayned, is good to heal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in the Eyes and Eye-lids, and to aſſwage ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and inflammations; and being applyed with Honey or boiled in Wine, it takes away all black and blue ſpots that happen therein. The ſeed of Baſtard Rubarb helpeth gripings knawings, and loathings of the Stomach. The roots help rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs of the nails, and being boiled in Wine it helps the Kings Evil, and ſwellings of the Kernels of the Ears; it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo provokes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, helps ſuch as are troubled with the Stone, and dimneſs of ſight; it is effectually uſed with other things in opening and purging dyet drinks to open the Liver, and cleanſe and cool the blood. The root of Monks Rubarb alſo purgeth, but more weakly then either of the other; but the root thereof bindeth the Belly, and ſtayeth Lasks and the bloody Flux; and ſo doth the root of the true Rubarb, if it be toaſted and taken in Plantain water, red-Wine, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, or Marmalade of Quinces, as I have often found to my great comfort: the diſtilled water hereof is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to heal Scabs, and foul Sores, and to allay the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; for which purpoſe alſo the juyce of the leaves or roots, or the decoction thereof in Vinegar is an effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: ſome uſe Indian Spikenard with Rubarb to correct it; yet it doth not much need any corrigent.</p>

A decoction made thereof with ſome Dill-leaves and flowers, eaſeth pains and torments being drunk inwardly, and applyed outwardly to the grieved place. The ſame decoction being drunk helps pains of the Cheſts and Sides, Coughs, difficulty of breathing, and inflammations of the Lungs, and eaſeth the Sciatica, and pains of the Joynts, being applyed thereto, or the parts anointed with an oyntment made hereof; it helps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſhakings of Agues, a draught of the decoction being drunk before the coming of the ſit: an oyl made of Rue by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion or decoction, helps the winde Chollick, hardneſs, windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuffocation of the Mother, the ſhare and parts about it being anointed therewith: A decoction thereof in Wine with a little Honey added to it, killeth and driveth forth Worms out of the Body. <hi>Mithridates</hi> uſed a Counter-poiſon to preſerve himſelf againſt infection, made thus; take twenty leaves of Rue, two Figs, two Walnuts, twenty Juniper berries, and a little Salt; which being beaten together into a Maſs was his deſe. appointed for every morning.
